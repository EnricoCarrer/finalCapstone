## 2. Prefixes and Suffixes
A group of Python functions that, given a set of words, create new words by adding or removing prefixes and suffixes.
  1. Add a prefix to a word: this function takes a word as parameter and adds the prefix "un" at the front of the word.
  2. Add prefixes to word groups: this function takes a list of words including a prefix and other words. Then it adds the prefix to each of the other words.
  3. Remove a suffix from a word: this function takes a word with the suffix "ness" and returns the root word by removing the suffix. When necessary, it also repalces the last letter "i" with the letter "y".
  4. Extract and transform a word into a verb: this function takes a sentence and an index as parameters. The index indicates an adjective in the sentence that will be transformed into a verb.
